HTTP Client written in Go

A productive leightweight HTTP Client written in Go. 

An HTTP client has the following components:
    1. An HTTP request, e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE & PATCH.
    2. A URL of the client.
    3. A set of headers that we need pass.
    4. A body of the request.

The whole request/response process is called Round Trip.

Furthermore, we provide unit, integration and functional test features for the HTTP client.
